GPU-accelerated multi-omics pipeline to quantify and visualize the *Mitochondrial Health Index (MHI)* by integrating extracellular vesicle/mitochondrial-derived vesicle (EV/MDV) proteomics with single-cell RNA-seq.

Hackathon project by *Team Go Getters* at the NVIDIA Accelerate Omics Hackathon (8-25 Sept 2025).

## üöÄ Project Objective

* Develop a *GPU-accelerated pipeline* for mitochondrial health analysis.
* Link blood-derived EV/MDV proteomics with mitochondrial DNA copy-number proxies from scRNA-seq.
* Provide interpretable measures:

  * *Biogenesis* (capacity to grow new mitochondria)
  * *Fusion/Fission* (structural remodeling)
  * *Mitophagy* (repair/recycling)
  * *Heterogeneity* (variation across cells).
* Output: a unified *Mitochondrial Health Index (MHI)* summarizing mitochondrial resilience, fitness, and disease risk.

## ‚ö° Installation

```bash
pip install mitoomics-gpu
```

---
## üñ•Ô∏è GPU Acceleration

* Optimized with RAPIDS + GPU backends.
* Clear *CPU vs GPU speedups* for large datasets.
* Open-source, designed for integration with *scverse/rapids-singlecell*.


## üìä Key Insights

* Unified mitochondrial health scoring (MHI).
* Patient-level and cell-type‚Äìlevel insights.
* Supports biomarker discovery, disease progression prediction, and drug response stratification.

---

## üîÆ Future Directions

* Add modalities: scATAC, metabolomics, spatial transcriptomics.
* Deploy web-server / pip package for biologist-friendly use.
* Clinical validation with partners & cohorts.
* ML upgrades for pattern discovery & prediction on MHI.
